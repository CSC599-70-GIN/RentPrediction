Intended strategy to improve performance for the final round:

Our intended strategy consists of two parts: 1) testing and improving our model of choice, and 2) incorporating two external datasets. For this initial submission, we had some trouble with the hyperparameters so we will look into how to select good ranges for our hyperparameters in our current models and any other models (such as gradient boosting or ensemble learning) that we decide to test. We will also be adding on features based on the NYPD Historic Complaint Dataset and NYC Airbnb Open Dataset (linked below). Two ideas we have are aggregating the number of complaints per zip code or borough for the complaint dataset and finding the average price of an Airbnb room / listing by neighborhood.
